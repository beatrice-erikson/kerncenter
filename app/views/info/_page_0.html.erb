<h2>VALUES INTO PRACTICE</h2>
<p>The R.W. Kern Center is a living symbol of Hampshire’s values in practice and ideas in action. Our first major new building in three decades, it was built with the goal of certification under the world’s most advanced green building standard, the Living Building Challenge: supplying its own energy and water, treating its own waste, and built avoiding toxic “red list” chemicals using materials mainly from local and regional sources. The center is a major piece of Hampshire’s broad sustainability initiative to make campus operations carbon neutral, including a plan to go 100 percent solar for campus electricity this year.</p>
